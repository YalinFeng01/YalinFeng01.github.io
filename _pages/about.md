I am currently a Master of Science student in Computer Control & Automation at **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**, Singapore. My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning and multimodal systems, with a particular focus on **Personalized Generation**, **Continual Learning**, and **AIGC**.

Currently, I work as a **Research Assistant** at the **Shanghai Academy of AI for Algorithms (IAAR)**, where I am developing continual learning frameworks to address catastrophic forgetting in personalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Previously, I was a Research Assistant at **A*STAR** in Singapore, focusing on cross-domain retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for Text-to-SQL tasks.

My research aims to build more adaptable and efficient AI systems that can learn continuously without forgetting previous knowledge, while also enabling high-quality, personalized content generation.

Research Interests
======
* **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**: Enhancing the capabilities of models to understand and generate content across text, image, and video modalities.
* **Continual Learning**: Developing algorithms that allow AI models to learn new tasks sequentially without catastrophic forgetting.
* **Personalized Generation**: Creating generative models that can adapt to specific user preferences or identities.
* **AIGC**: Exploring advanced generative techniques, including hybrid architectures (RNN-Transformer) for efficient text-to-video synthesis and diffusion models.

Education
======
* **M.Sc. in Computer Control & Automation**, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore (2025 - Present)
* **B.Eng. in Computer Science & Technology**, Henan University, China (2020 - 2024)
* **B.Eng. in Software Engineering (Joint Program)**, Victoria University, Australia (2020 - 2024)
